 Write a program to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Rot13 cipher technique in C#. In this technique, each letter in a message is replaced with the letter that comes 13 places after it in the alphabet. To decrypt the message, the same algorithm is applied again. The program should prompt the user to enter a message, encrypt it using the Rot13 cipher, then print the encrypted message. It should then decrypt the encrypted message and print the original message. The program should handle both upper and lowercase letters, and ignore any characters that are not letters.
